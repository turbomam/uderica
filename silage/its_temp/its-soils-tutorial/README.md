The files in this directory are derived from a study performed by Scott Bates, Jon Leff, Chris Lauber, and Noah Fierer at the University of Colorado at Boulder (manuscript currently in preparation). The tutorial and example files were compiled by Greg Caporaso at Northern Arizona University. Questions about these files should be directed to the QIIME Forum at http://forum.qiime.org.

We wish to acknowledge the Sloan Foundation who funded the Fungal Community Analysis workshop in Boulder, CO in October, 2012 where initial discussions of this tutorial began.
