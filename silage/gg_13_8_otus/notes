Greengenes minor release to address missing genus and species names. These
corrections were sourced by the OTU clusters for the 99% OTUs. Specifically,
For each OTU, if it lacked a genus or a species name, the NCBI taxonomy of
the cluster members were examined and the most supported name(s) were chosen
to update the taxonomy of the representative sequence. Taxonomy information
was then propagated to all the lower similarity representative sequences.

A few key notes:
- The annotated trees do not reflect these taxonomy updates
- The tree topology was not updated
- Only the taxonomy/ files have been modified from the GG 13_5 release
